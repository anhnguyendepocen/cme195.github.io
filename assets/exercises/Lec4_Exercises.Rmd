# Original plot and data

For practice, you will try to recreate
a plot published in the Economist issue of July 20th, 2016 reflecting
the relationship between well-being and financial inclusion.

* The original graph can be found 
[here](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2016/07/daily-chart-13)

* You will generate this figure step by step through a series of included 
exercises using the tools we've just learned and will learn about. 


The data for the exercises `EconomistData.csv` can be downloaded from 
the class github repository.

```{r}
url <- paste0("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cme195/cme195.github.io/",
              "master/assets/data/EconomistData.csv")
dat <- read.csv(url)
head(dat)
```


# Exercise 1

1. Create a scatter plot with percent of people over the age of 15 with a bank 
account on the x axis and the SEDA score on the y axis.
2. Color the points in the previous plot blue.
3. Color the points in the previous plot according to the `Region`.
4. Create boxplots of SEDA scores by `Region`.
5. Overlay points on top of the box plots


# Exercise 2

1. Re-create a scatter plot with percent of people aged 15+ with a bank account
on the x axis and SEDA current level score on the y axis 
(as you did in the previous exercise).
2. Overlay a smoothing line on top of the scatter plot using the lm method. 
Hint: see `?stat_smooth`.
3. Overlay a smoothing line on top of the scatter plot using the default method.
4. Overlay a smoothing line on top of the scatter plot using the default loess 
method, but make it less smooth. Hint: see `?loess`.


# Exercise 3

1. For the scatter plot of % of ppl aged 15+ with bank account vs SEDA score
colored by region, generated in Exercise I.3 modify the color scale to 
use specific values of your choosing. Hint: see `?scale_color_manual`.

# Exercise 4

1. Facet  by region (`~ Region`) the the Economist plot from Exercise 3.

# Exercise 5

Finish the Economist plot:

1. Change order of the Regions
2. Add the linear trend
3. Change the axes ratio.
4. Change the color scheme. Use these colors 
`colors <-  c("#28AADC","#F2583F", "#76C0C1","#24576D", "#248E84","#DCC3AA", "#96503F")`
5. Add a title and format the axes
6. Change the background and theme
7. Format the legend
8. Add point labels
9. Add notes to the bottom and save the plot
