an extra tutorial on importing data to R needs to be run locally. You can
get it by installing my tutorials with `devtools::install_github("nlhuong/rexercises")`,
Then, run a tutorial with the following command:
`learnr::run_tutorial("data_to_R", package = "rexercises")`


Tutorials might include bugs, or some unclear hints. Please, let me know
if you encounter any mistakes in the tutorials so I can fix them.
