# [](#project) Final Project [Optional]

Choose a project that interests and excites you. It is intended as a chance for
you to get more practice with R and to explore its more advanced tools. You
might consider working on a problem related to your own research and  use your
own data. However, you should **focus more on programming rather than on
answering a research question**. Through the project you should demonstrate the
skills you have learned by taking this class, but you are **encouraged to
implement material not taught in class**.

You are responsible for formulating your own project. However, you should
consult with me on the scope of your planned work. Below, I included a list of
topics you might want to consider when planning your project.

The goal of the project should be to have fun. You take this class because you
want to learn about R, and this is your opportunity to use R in any
way you like. As a rough estimate, the project should take you around 20 hours
of work (each).

## [](#deadlines)  Schedule for deliverables:

* Proposal (title and one-paragraph abstract) due **10/24 by the end of class**.
* Final write-up and R code due a week after the last class **11/15 at noon**.

Everything should be uploaded on
[canvas](https://web.stanford.edu/group/canvas/discovery/) before the
deadline.

## [](#ideas) Project Ideas:

 * [Sports data](https://www.r-bloggers.com/sports-data-and-r-scope-for-a-thematic-rather-than-task-view-living-post/).
 For example, decide which basketball player would you want on your team?

 - [Financial data](https://www.quandl.com/browse ). Analyze stock returns, or
 compute optimal portfolios. Check what people in the field do
 [here](http://www.rinfinance.com/agenda/) and see resources
 [here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/r-and-finance/ ).

 - [Twitter data](http://geoffjentry.hexdump.org/twitteR.pdf ).
 Use the content of the posts to perform activity and sentiment analysis.
 You might want to check out
 [Donald Trump's tweet analysis](http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-tweets/ ).

- [Yelp data](https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge ) Similar analysis can be
done for yelp data as for twitter data, as done
[here](http://varianceexplained.org/r/yelp-sentiment/ ).

 - [Movie preference data](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ )
 For example develop a movie recommender system.

 - [Cities/States data.](http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/15182715327/list-of-citiesstates-with-open-data-help-me)
 Use them to either:
    - identify the best and worst neighborhoods to live in based on different
    metrics like how many parks are within walking distance, crime statistics, etc.
    - identify concrete measures your city could take to improve different
    quality of life metrics like those described above â€“ say where should
    the city put a park, or
    - predict when/where crimes will occur

 - Biological data. Projects could involve e.g. differential expression,
 flow cytometry, mass spectronomy, image analysis, or phylogeny estimation,
 clustering of single cells, data visualization multivariate analyses. There
 are many packages on Bioconductor or CRAN that are specifically developed
 to perform these kind of analyses. Many datasets and implementations are
 available on Bioconductor repository.

 - Find a [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) present
 or past and solve the problem using R.

 - Find a dataset on
 [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.html )
 and try to draw some interesting insigts.

 - Or create a stunning set of visualizations for a data set of your choice.
