CME 195/STATS 195: Introduction to R
================================

This short course runs for four weeks beginning in the second week of the
quarter. It is recommended for students who want to use R in statistics,
science, or engineering courses and for students who want to learn the basics of
R programming. The goal of the short course is to familiarize students with R's
tools for scientific computing. Lectures will be interactive with a focus on
learning by example, and assignments will be application-driven. No prior
programming experience is needed. Topics covered include basic data structures,
File I/O, graphs, control structures, etc, and some useful packages in R.


== Announcements
- To get a head start, please install R (version >= 3.3.0) and RStudio IDE
(preview version). Instructions for this can be found [installation.html *here*].
- Complete a [https://goo.gl/forms/1UzF8GFdJFaEI3Uw2 *survey*] to let
me know your experience with R and what you expect from the class.

== Course description

This short course runs for the first four weeks of the quarter and is offered in
fall and spring. It is recommended for students who want to use R in statistics,
science, or engineering courses and for students who want to learn the basics of
R programming.

The goal of the short course is to *familiarize students with R's tools for
scientific computing*. Class lectures will be interactive with a focus on
learning by example, and assignments will be application-driven.

Topics covered include:

- basic data structures,
- file I/O,
- control structures,
- functions
- visualizations,
- statistics packages.


== Course prerequisites

There are no formal prerequisites.
However, *some statistics knowledge and prior programming experience in some
language is strongly encouraged*. The class focuses on familiarizing students
with the R language, and some of its statistics and visualization packages.
We will not have time to go over the technical details or the mathematics of
the methods presented. Optional reading will be assigned before or after
class, for students who want to learn more about the techniques presented.


== Course Policy

The course consists of 8 *interactive classes*, which include hands-on, in-class exercises. Laptops will be needed for every class. *Questions are
encouraged* at any time as long as they do not disturb other students
or the lecture flow.

There will be *two homework sets*, assigned the second and third week of class
(due the following week). You are also expected to submit a *final project*
(in groups up to 3 students). You are free to choose the topic
for your final projects yourself. Please submit a title and a one-paragraph
summary/abstract for your intended project by the third week of class.

You are encouraged to take the class for credit, as it forces you to get more
practice with R. However, anyone is also *welcome to audit* the class, but auditors will not be able to have their assignments graded.

== Honor code

You are strongly encouraged to work together and discuss both exercises and
the project. However, the write-ups and the code for the homeworks
should be completed and submitted individually.
You are also free to use online resources or solutions to the problems you find
e.g. on stackexchange but of course not the full solutions to the assigned
exercises.
