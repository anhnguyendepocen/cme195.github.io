## [](#course) Course Description

This short course runs for four weeks and is offered in fall and spring. 
It is recommended for students who want to use R in statistics, science
or engineering courses, and for students who want to learn the basics of data 
science with R. The goal of the short course is to familiarize students with 
some of the most important R tools for data analysis. Lectures will focus 
on learning by example and assignments will be application-driven. 
No prior programming experience is assumed.

At the end of this class you should be able to:

- Import raw data into R.
- Tidy and transform data into a format that is convenient for analysis.
- Visualize data and make beautiful plots.
- Use R to fit simple models, use them to make predictions and test hypotheses.
- Use R Markdown to efficiently communicate your data and results.

Some things that you will not learn from this class:

- Big data: this class does not cover tools for analyzing large dataset which 
do not fit in-memory.
- Programming: this is not a programming course. If you want to learn the 
fundamentals of computer programming, you should take a different class 
(and probably start with a different language).
- Statistics: we will not be going over the technical details or the mathematics 
of the methods presented.


## [](#textbook) Optional textbook

["R for Data Science"](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) 
by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. 


## [](#prereq) Course prerequisites

There are no formal prerequisites. However, some statistics knowledge and prior 
programming experience is encouraged.


## [](#policy) Course Policy

Grading (Satisfactory/No Credit):

 - participation: 20% 
 - homework: 40%
 - final project: 40%

There will be one homework sets due the third week of class. 
You are also expected to submit a final project (in groups up to 4 students).
You are free to choose a topic for your final projects yourself. Please submit 
a title and a one-paragraph summary/abstract for your intended project by the 
third week of class. The final report and R code are due a week after the last 
class.

You are encouraged to take the class for credit, as it forces you to get more
practice with R. However, anyone is also welcome to audit the class, but
auditors will not be able to have their assignments graded.

## [](#honorcode) Honor code

Please review 
[the Stanford CS honor code](https://cs.stanford.edu/degrees/ug/HonorCode.shtml), 
which binds students enrolled in this course.


## [](#accessibility) Students with disabilities

Students with Documented Disabilities: Students who may need an academic 
accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request 
with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will 
evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable 
accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty. Unless the 
student has a temporary disability, Accommodation letters are issued for the 
entire academic year. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since 
timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. The OAE is located at 
563 Salvatierra Walk (phone: 723-1066, URL: (https://oae.stanford.edu/)).
